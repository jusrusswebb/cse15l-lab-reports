# Installing VS Code

First, head to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and follow the system specific instructions for either masOS or Windows. If you are working with a PC you will need to scroll down to the bottom of the page to find the download instructions.

After VS code is downloaded, open your files and look for VS code Zip file. After you click on the zip file, a file named Visual Studio Code should be downloaded into your files.

Once you click on the Visual Studio Code file in your files you should reach a home page that looks similar to the one below. To get started, you can either open an existing file or create a new one by clicking New File.

# Remotely Connecting

Open the terminal in VS code.(Ctrl or Command + `, or use the Terminal → New Terminal menu option), and type in ssh followed by your account name.

Past this point, I was unable to remotely connect as it was not accepting my password. I continued to change and input different password across multiple methods, but nothing has seemed to work thus far. I emailed Proffesor Politz and when the issue is fixed I will update this tutorial.
