After VS code is downloaded, open your files and look for VS code Zip file. After you click on the zip file, a file named Visual Studio Code should be downloaded into your files.

Once you click on the Visual Studio Code file in your files you should reach a home page that looks similar to the one below. To get started, you can either open an existing file or create a new one by clicking New File.
