    Death, personified as a woman and dressed in white clothing, is a well-known character in Chicano and Mexicano folklore. Commonly accepted as just La Muerte, she is a frequent personality in legends, urban belief tales, and is integrated into many family folk belief systems. Death is sometimes feared, but it is also accepted as the transition to another stage of the life cycle. A common saying is “De la muerte y la suerte nadie se escapa” (No one escapes from death or luck) (Espinosa, A. M., 1910, 404). She habitually appears late at night, to men who are out alone, some intentionally, others innocently on their way home from work. In tales collected in the Southwest, La Muerte is seen standing at streetlights, or waiting by a bridge or the side of the road.

It provides the perfect setting for Schloß Cecilienhof (1916), the ivy-covered, half-timbered pastiche of an English country manor built for Crown Prince Wilhelm and his wife. Winston Churchill, Joseph Stalin, and Harry Truman met here in July 1945 to draw up the Potsdam Agreement that fixed the division of Germany for the next 45 years. Today it’s a luxury hotel and restaurant.
