    Death, personified as a woman and dressed in white clothing, is a well-known character in Chicano and Mexicano folklore. Commonly accepted as just La Muerte, she is a frequent personality in legends, urban belief tales, and is integrated into many family folk belief systems. Death is sometimes feared, but it is also accepted as the transition to another stage of the life cycle. A common saying is “De la muerte y la suerte nadie se escapa” (No one escapes from death or luck) (Espinosa, A. M., 1910, 404). She habitually appears late at night, to men who are out alone, some intentionally, others innocently on their way home from work. In tales collected in the Southwest, La Muerte is seen standing at streetlights, or waiting by a bridge or the side of the road.
    
The command above is searching through chM.txt for text that appears near the word "habitually". This could be useful if you remember that word "habitually" being related to a section of the text that talks about something specific you are looking for.
